## Introduction

Welcome to the Express CI Pipeline project! This project demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for an Express.js application.

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose of the CI/CD Pipeline

The primary goal of this CI/CD pipeline is to automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring that any changes made to the code are quickly and efficiently integrated into the production environment.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Jenkins**: Automation server for building and deploying applications.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging applications and their dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

### System Requirements

- A modern operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Sufficient system resources (CPU, RAM, and disk space) to run Node.js and Docker.

### Required Software and Tools

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later recommended)
- **npm** (usually comes with Node.js)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Jenkins** (or your preferred CI tool)

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Piipip/express-ci-pipeline.git
   cd express-ci-pipeline
